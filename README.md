Welcome to the Humidefi DApp repository! This repository contains the frontend framework for Humidefi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project operating within the Polkadot ecosystem.

## üöÄ About Humidefi
Humidefi leverages Substrate‚Äôs interoperability, runtime customization, cross-chain communication, security, and scalability features to provide easy-to-use and understandable DeFi services within the Polkadot ecosystem. The project aims to foster financial inclusion and innovation within the Polkadot network by enabling broader access to decentralized finance.

## ‚úÖ Features
* **Teleport**: Establishes a connection between Xode and the Asset Hub Parachain within the Kusama network, facilitating asset teleportation bidirectionally using the XCM protocol.
* **Liquidity**: Allows liquidity providers to deposit asset pairs into liquidity pools and earn fees based on trading activities.
* **Swap**: Enables users to swap between different assets with reduced slippage and fees.
* **Redemption**: Allows liquidity pool token holders to redeem their tokens after a 60-day holding period, receiving an equivalent pair quantity based on the current price.
* **Ecosystem** Fit: Strategically aligned with the core principles of the Polkadot ecosystem, including interoperability, customization, security, and scalability.
* **Integration** with Xode: Enhances Xode's utility by integrating DeFi services, such as liquidity provision and asset swapping, within the Web3 Gaming platform.

# About the Repository

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.0.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## üìù Future Plans
In the short term, Humidefi is focused on driving adoption through its integration with the XGame platform within Xode. This initiative aims to provide immediate liquidity to game tokens, enhancing the user experience by enabling seamless token teleportation, swapping, and transfer functionalities. Additionally, users will have the opportunity to participate in liquidity reserves and earn yields, further incentivizing engagement within the ecosystem. During periods of non-utilization, Humidefi will prioritize enhancing existing features while introducing new functionalities such as staking, loans, and other DeFi products to enrich the platform‚Äôs offerings.

Looking ahead to the long term, Humidefi‚Äôs vision encompasses the creation of a dedicated Parachain and utility token, UMI, exclusively tailored for its ecosystem. To facilitate this ambitious endeavor, Humidefi plans to leverage decentralized token raises, such as Polimec, or other reputable platforms to secure the necessary funding. By establishing a dedicated Parachain and utility token, Humidefi aims to solidify its presence within the decentralized finance landscape, fostering sustainable growth and innovation within its ecosystem.
